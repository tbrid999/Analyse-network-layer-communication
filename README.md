Cybersecurity Incident Report for www.yummyrecipesforme.com
Part One: Analysis of the tcpdump Log
Summary of the Issue: After analyzing the tcpdump log, it is clear that the problem lies with the DNS resolution process. The browser initiated queries to resolve the IP address of www.yummyrecipesforme.com using UDP protocol on port 53. However, the DNS server at 203.0.113.2 responded with an ICMP error, stating that UDP port 53 is unreachable.

Details from the Log:

The browser sent DNS queries using the UDP protocol with the query type A? to port 53 of the DNS server.
The DNS server responded with ICMP messages stating "udp port 53 unreachable," indicating no service was available to process the DNS request.
Multiple attempts were made, but all resulted in the same error, showing that the issue persisted consistently during the analysis.
Findings:

The DNS server is either misconfigured or its service has stopped running, making it unable to respond to queries on port 53.
This prevents DNS resolution, which is necessary for translating the domain name to an IP address, leading to the website being inaccessible.
Part Two: Analysis of the Data and Proposed Solution
Timeline and Reporting:

The issue was first reported by clients’ customers who were unable to access the website and received a “destination port unreachable” error.
During internal testing, the error was reproduced, and the tcpdump log was captured for analysis.
Scenario and Observations:

The browser’s DNS request for resolving the IP address of www.yummyrecipesforme.com was sent to the DNS server but failed because port 53 was unreachable.
The issue stems from the DNS server, as indicated by the ICMP error messages.
Current Status:

The website remains inaccessible due to the failure of DNS resolution.
ICMP responses confirm that the DNS server is not functioning correctly on port 53.
Information Discovered:

The DNS server at 203.0.113.2 is not properly handling UDP queries on port 53.
The issue could be caused by a misconfiguration, the DNS service being stopped, or a firewall blocking the port.
Next Steps:

Verify the DNS Service: Check if the DNS service is running on the server and restart it if necessary.
Inspect Port Configuration: Ensure that port 53 is open and configured to handle UDP traffic.
Check Firewall Settings: Verify that no firewall or network policy is blocking UDP traffic to port 53 on the DNS server.
Implement DNS Redundancy: Add a secondary DNS server to ensure future queries are not entirely dependent on one server.
Monitor DNS Server Health: Set up monitoring to detect issues with the DNS server before they impact users.
Suspected Root Cause: The root cause appears to be a misconfiguration or failure on the DNS server, which has resulted in it not listening or responding on UDP port 53.

Proposed Solution:

Immediate Fix: Restart the DNS service and ensure port 53 is properly configured to handle UDP traffic.
Long-term Fix: Implement a secondary DNS server for redundancy, regularly audit DNS configurations, and set up proactive monitoring to catch potential issues early.
